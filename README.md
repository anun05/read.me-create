  ## Installation
  The way the project works, first the user  will need to  clone it into the users local repo, from there they must run npm insatall so all the proper npm packages can be instealled. Thus, after all this, Inquirer will be set up so it may be used from its command line. Once everything there is done, rune node.js in the command line and procceed to answer the questions. After all this, it will appear as a read.md file.

  ## Usage

  The way to use this project is by running node index.js in the command line. From here, the inquirer package will take the user to the command line where the questions will begin to appear and the user must answer them.
